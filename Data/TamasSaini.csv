1,"To lure a pig into his room was no easy task for Nathu. He had seen stray pigs hovering over garbage heaps."
2,"So he carried garbage in big heaps and scattered it outside the courtyard, in front of the door, and inside his dilapidated room."
3,"The evening shadows had started descending when he saw three large pigs emerging from behind a dung heap."
4,"One of them raised its snout, sniffed the air, and entered the courtyard Nathu immediately closed the door of the courtyard."
5,"And, running forward, opened the door of his room and then, lifting his lathi, manoeuvred the pig into his room."
6,"To prevent the pig from squealing and attracting its owner's attention, Nathu brought more garbage into the room for it to gorge on."
7,"Having secured the animal Nathu entrenched himself outside the door and smoked one bidi after another, waiting for nightfall." 
8,"After a long patient wait, when it was finally dark he ventured back into the room. In the dim, wavering light of the clay lamp he saw that the garbage lay scattered all over the floor, filling the room with its stench."
9,"Then his eyes fell on the big, powerful brute. It looked huge and forbidding. His heart sank- He felt like flinging the door open and letting the pig out."
10,"Still, he felt like flinging the door open and letting the pig out."
11,"More than half the night was gone and the pig was still very much alive, still gobbling up garbage." 
12,"There were clots of blood on the floor and a few scratches on the pig's belly. Otherwise, the scene had undergone no significant change."
13,"The pig was in fine fettle whe- reas Nathu was breathing heavily."
14,"He felt helpless. From a friend he could turn into an enemy."  
15,"Nathu got up in alarm; glared at the pig. Planting its feet on a heap of garbage, the pig urinated and then resumed its -walk, round and round the room."
16,"And it angrily moved from the middle of the room to walk close to the right wall. The lamp's flame started flickering again."
17,"And the shadows began swaying on the wall repeatedly like some nightmare. There was no change in the situation at all."  
18,"Its eyes fixed on the floor, the pig would trot along the wall as if searching for something. Then it would suddenly squeal and move away."
19,"Its small tail curled over its back like a whiplash. Rheum, oozing from its left eye, had trickled down to its snout."
20,"'I wish I knew what to do!' Nathu thought in angry frustration. This brute is going to be the death of me.'"
21,"He decided to make one more attempt to catch hold of the pig's hind legs and roll it over on the floor. Holding the knife aloft in his left hand, he cautiously moved to the middle of the room."
22,"The pig, reaching the end of the right wall, turned and started walking along the left side of the room. Instead of running away on seeing Nathu coming towards it, it turned and started moving towards Nathu."
23,"Once the pig grunted as if to charge at Nathu, but didn't really. Nathu started retreating step by step."
24,"His eyes were still fixed on the pig's snout. The pig was now right in front of him, moving menacingly towards him."
25,"In this situation, it had become impossible for him to catch its hind legs and roll it over on its back."
26,"The pig's tiny red eyes were bloodshot. Who knew what it might do? But Nathu was getting desperate."
27,"Two o'clock had struck and what could not be achieved from the evening till now, how would it be possible before dawn? The sweeper's cart could come any time and if the job was not done, what about Murad Ali? From a friend he could turn into an enemy, stop giving him hides, have him ejected from his hovel, get someone to beat him up, harass him."
28,"Nathu's hands and feet went limp. He knew in his heart that if he grabbed the pig by its hind legs, it would struggle violently or lash out to free itself from his grip."
29,"Suddenly Nathu flared up, without any apparent reason, as if a spark had been kindled in his entire being."
30,"Me or the pig, he muttered and quickly turned and picked up a large slab lying near the alcove. Holding the slab aloft, he planted himself in the middle of the room."
31,"Holding the stone slab over his head, he stood stiffly erect, watching the animal. The pig had lost interest in him and was sniffing at the rind of a water melon, its red eyes blinking, its small tail waving at its back."
32,"If the animal stood still like that, the slab could cause it considerable injury and it would be slowed down effectively."
33,"If the slab hit it squarely, it was bound to inflict some injury and break a leg or some other part of its body."
34,"Even if one of its legs broke, it would be a blessing in disguise as its movement would be impeded. With both hands Nathu took aim and flung the slab at the pig."
35,"The lamp wavered; the shadows on the wall shook. The slab hit the pig"
36,"but Nathu could not tell on which part of its body for he had turned his face away as he let go of the slab. The pig grunted loudly as the slab hit it. But, to Nathu's surprise, the pig still seemed unhurt in any significant way."
37,"Nathu had turned away the moment he released the slab and was now peering at the pig. He was amazed to see that the pig's half-closed eyes were still blinking and its snout was still resting on its front legs."
38,"Suddenly, the pig grunted again, and walked to the middle of the room, its belly swaying from side to side. Nathu stationed himself at the door opening into the courtyard."
39,"Under the wavering light of the lamp he could see the pig, a solid black mass, walking ponderously towards him. It looked as though the slab had hit it on its head and, feeling dazed, it was having difficulty seeing."
40,"Nathu felt scared. Was the pig going to charge him? It could bite him, maul him badly."
41,"Otherwise, the scene had undergone no significant change."
42,"Quickly opening the door he slipped out of the room."
43,"As the wind blew against his perspiring body he felt alive again."
44,"The streaming wind came as a relief."
45,"For a moment he felt as if he had been reborn, his limp, flagging body had been infused with new life."
46,"Tomorrow I'll return the five-rupee note to Murad Ali and folds my hands before him. 'Hazoor, this job is beyond me.' I'll tell him."
47,"He can't do me any harm. For two days he will go about grim-faced."  
48,"On the third day I'll place my head at his feet and he'll relent."
49,"The moon had come out, softening and rearranging the perspective of the familiar scene around him."
50,"Across the road, wild berry trees, thorny bushes and cactus plants grew along the steep slopes that descended to the maidan, beyond which lay the graveyard."
51,"Throughout the day, one could hear the creaking of the bullock carts and the jingle of bells around the bullocks' necks as the carts passed along the din road. But now the road lay deserted and quiet."
52,"Behind the graveyard stood the huts inhabited by low caste grave diggers."
