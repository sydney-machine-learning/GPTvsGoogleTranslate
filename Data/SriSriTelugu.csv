48,"Suddenly, that lamp saw a star in the sky. It cried out like a she-demon. (Cries that would pierce your ears and mine) The star showered its affectionate glances. The poor lamp grew weary. The star sang its inviting song. The lamp went out. It transformed into a star."

56,"A puppy, a spark, a bubble - do not look down upon anything! Everything is poetic! A bread crumb, a drop of sweat, a small fish - they all gaze at you! They ask you to fathom their depths! A doorknob, a bead necklace, a horse's anklet - none of these is unworthy of poetry! Each is a priceless sculpture! One must possess poetic frenzy! But one must also have the direction of aesthetic taste! Failing which, not a hint of beauty will be found! If you have eyes, see and write! If you have speech, speak and write! The world is a lotus array! Poetry is an unquenchable thirst!"

59,"In the villages where eyes pause to gaze, how anxiously must the mother be calling out...? When thoughts scorch like blazing embers, when throbbing headaches intensify like stabbing awls, when the black night settles like a weight on the heart, when visions of the calling mother materialize before the eyes, thinking of those piercing calls - the mother's doorstep, the village path, the wayfarer's path - how much hardship!"
60,"That was the end of his life's journey! In the pitch darkness, fireflies glimmered; drenched by rain, a lightning flash flickered; a cock crew announcing the approaching dawn; amidst the dispersing clouds, a streak of morning light shone; the chilly wind is playing with the wayfarer's chariot body! In some village, a slight stir in the mother's mournful dreams!"
