1,"Dhritarashtra said: On the sacred land of Kurukshetra, where the armies were assembled and eager to fight, Sanjaya, what did my sons and the Pandavas do?"
2,"Sanjaya said: O King, seeing the Pandava army arrayed in battle formation, Duryodhana then approached his teacher and spoke these words."
3,"""Behold, O great teacher, this mighty army of the Pandavas' sons, arrayed by Drupada's son, your wise disciple."""
4,"""Here are mighty warriors, great bowmen like Bhima and Arjuna; Yudhanyuna, Virata, and the great charioteer Drupada."""
5,"""Dhristhaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya, the best among men."""
6,"""Yudhmanyu, the brave, Uttamauja, the powerful, Saubhadra, and the sons of Draupadi – all are great chariot warriors."""
7,"""Now hear, O best of twice-born, those who are especially distinguished on my side. I will name them for your information, the leaders of my army."""
8,"""The glorious Bhishma, Kripa, the ever-victorious Karna, Ashwatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta are here."""
9,"""Many other brave warriors, who have renounced their lives for my sake, are here, all equipped with various weapons and skilled in battle."""
10,"""Our army, protected by Bhishma, is insufficient; while their army, protected by Bhima, seems to be sufficient."""
11,"""Therefore, on all sides, let all of you carefully protect Bhishma alone, as he stands according to his vow in every encounter."""
12,"Hearing these encouraging words of Sanjaya, the aged Kuru grandfather, Bhishma, the mighty one, blew his conch shell loudly."
13,"Then, conches, drums, kettledrums, cowhorns, and trumpets – all were blared simultaneously, and the sound was tumultuous."
14,"Then, standing in a great chariot yoked with white horses, Madhava (Krishna) and Pandava (Arjuna) blew their divine conch shells."
15,"Hrishikesha (Krishna) blew the Panchajanya, and Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew the Devadatta. Bhimasena, the fierce one, with a wolf's cry, blew the Paundra."
16,"King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya. Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughoṣa and Manipushpaka respectively."
17,"Kasya, the great devotee, the great chariot warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the undefeated Satyaki,"
18,"Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, O king, and the mighty-armed Saubhadra – all blew their conch shells separately."
19,"That sound pierced the hearts of the Dhartarashtra army and reverberated through the sky and earth."
20,"Then, seeing the Dhartarashtras well-arrayed, Arjuna, the one with the monkey-banner, raised his bow as the clash of weapons began, and spoke these words to Hrishikesha."
21,"""O Achyuta, place my chariot in the middle of the two armies, so that I can see those who are here, desirous of fighting."
22,""With whom must I fight in this great battle?"""
23,"""I want to see those who have come here, assembled in this battle, eager to please Duryodhana's evil mind."""
24,"Sanjaya said: Having been thus spoken to by Gudakesha (Arjuna) in Bharat, Hrishikesha placed the excellent chariot"
25,"""In the middle of the two armies. O Partha, he said, ""Look at these Kurus assembled here, facing you."""
26,"There, Partha saw his fathers and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and companions On both sides, as well as fathers-in-law and friends."
27,"Seeing all these kinsmen standing there, filled with immense compassion, the son of Kunti became overwhelmed with grief and spoke thus:"
28,"Arjuna said: O Krishna, seeing these relatives standing eager to fight, my limbs fail, and my mouth becomes parched."
29,"My body trembles, and my hair stands on end. Gandiva (Arjuna's bow) slips from my hand, and my skin burns all over."
30,"My mind is whirling in confusion, and I am unable to hold myself steady any longer. O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle."
31,"O Govinda (Krishna), what is the use of victory, or kingdom, or even life, when those for whom we desire kingdom, enjoyment, and pleasure are standing here arrayed before us?"
32,"For whose sake do we desire kingdom, pleasures, or even life, O Govinda, when the teachers, fathers, sons, as well as grandfathers."
33,"Maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, sisters' sons, and also other relatives for whom we desire these things"
34,"Stand here wishing to fight, giving up their lives and wealth? O Madhusudana (Krishna), I do not wish to kill them, even though they may kill me."
35,"For what purpose, O Janardana (Arjuna), is kingship or enjoyment of earthly pleasures even worth acquiring, if we have to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra?"
36,"Sin will accrue to us by killing these aggressors, our relatives. Therefore, it is not proper for us to kill the Dhritarashtra sons, our kinsmen. How can we be happy, O Madhava, after slaying our own people?"
37,"Even though these men, their minds clouded by greed, do not see the sin caused by the destruction of the family or the crime in slaying friends"
38,"Shouldn't we, who have clear vision, understand how to turn away from this sin, O Janardana, considering the evil caused by the destruction of the family?"
39,"With the destruction of the family, the eternal family traditions perish. When dharma (righteousness) is lost, the whole family becomes overwhelmed by unrighteousness."
40,"O Krishna, with the predominance of unrighteousness, women of the family become corrupted. And with the corruption of women, O Varshneya (descendant of Vrishni), there arises intermixing of castes."
41,"This mixing of castes leads only to hell, both for the destroyers of the family and for the family itself. By such acts, the ancestors fall down, deprived of offerings of water and cake."
42,"By these sins of killing kinsmen and causing caste mixing, the eternal family traditions and the eternal duties of the family are destroyed, O Janardana."
43,"We have heard that those whose family traditions are destroyed dwell in hell eternally."
44,"Alas! We are about to commit a great sin by preparing to kill our own relatives out of greed for earthly pleasures and kingdom."
45,"If the sons of Dhritarashtra were to kill me in the battle, while I am unarmed and offering no resistance, that would be far better for me."
46,"Having spoken thus, Arjuna, in the midst of the battlefield, sank down onto the chariot seat, his mind overwhelmed with grief, abandoning his bow and arrows."
