1,"Bringing the wild boar inside the shed was no easy task. He had seen the wandering boar poking its snout in the garbage."
2,"He couldn't think of anything else. He kept picking up garbage from a pit and making a heap outside the broken shed near the door in the courtyard."
3,"As the evening shadows lengthened, three boars wandering near the pools of dirty water, piles of husk, and bushes covered in dust came that way."
4,"Just then, one of the boars sniffing the garbage entered the courtyard, and Natthu quickly shut the gate."
5,"Then he ran and opened the shed door on the other side of the courtyard and drove the boar inside with his stick."
6,"Afraid that the swineherd might come looking for the boar in that direction and hear its grunts, Natthu kept tossing garbage into the shed."
7,"Once the garbage was inside the shed, the boar disappeared into it, and Natthu sat outside the shed, smoking beedis and waiting for dusk to fall."
8,"Much later, as night began to fall, Natthu entered the shed. In the flickering light of the lantern, he saw that the garbage was strewn all over the shed."
9,"And a rotten, pungent smell emanated from it. Then, seeing the huge, ugly boar, his heart sank, and he regretted taking on this dirty, dangerous task."
10,"Still, he felt like opening the shed door and pushing the boar out."
11,"Now it was past midnight, and the boar lay wallowing in the garbage."
12,"There were bloodstains on its snout, a couple of gashes on its trunk, and wounds from its tusks on its own leg, that's all."
13,"The boar was alive and present inside the shed, while Natthu was panting."
14,"His body was drenched in sweat, and there seemed no way out of this ordeal. Two strokes rang out from the clock in the Sheikh's garden in the distance."
15,"Natthu stood up in alarm. His gaze fell again on the boar. The boar had urinated amidst the garbage scraps."
16,"Disgusted, it moved away from the center of the shed towards the right side wall. The lantern flame flickered again."
17,"The shadows swayed on the walls like a nightmare. The situation remained unchanged."
18,"The boar kept lowering its head, now sniffing the garbage with its tusk, now walking alongside the wall, and now"
19,"grunting and running alongside the wall. As before, its thin long tail kept coiling and uncoiling like a slender rope."
20,"'This won't do,' Natthu said through gritted teeth, 'this disease is beyond my control. This boar will devour me today.'"
21,"He thought he should try grabbing its leg again and toppling it over. Raising the knife in his left hand, he walked slowly into the center of the shed."
22,"The boar reached the far right corner wall and began circling close to the left side. Seeing Natthu approach, instead of fleeing, it turned towards him."
23,"The boar even feinted an attack on Natthu once. Natthu took a step back."
24,"His eyes were still fixed on the boar's tusks. Now the boar was right in front of him, charging at him."
25,"In this situation, it became impossible to grab its hind leg, pull it back and topple it over."
26,"There was frenzy in the boar's narrow red eyes. Who knows what it might do. But Natthu was getting anxious."
27,"It was two o'clock, and the task that could not be completed since the evening, how would it be done by daybreak? The landlord's messenger could arrive anytime, and if the work was not done, what trust could there be in Murad Ali? He could turn from friend to foe, stop providing hides, evict him from the shed, have him beaten, harass him."
28,"Natthu's hands and feet began to tremble. He knew that if he grabbed the boar's hind leg, it would struggle or lash out and free itself."
29,"Suddenly Natthu felt emboldened. For no apparent reason, it seemed a surge of energy coursed through his body."
30,"'Not me, not this,' he said and quickly turned to pick up the large rock lying near the pit. Holding the rock, he went straight to the center of the shed."
31,"He paused for a moment, holding the rock above his head with both hands. The boar's snout was still on its forelimbs. It was sniffing the burlap sack."
32,"Its red eyes were gleaming. Its small tail was constantly wagging behind its back."
33,"If it didn't move and the rock landed squarely on its body, it would definitely hit somewhere and at least fracture one of its limbs."
34,"Even if just one leg broke, it would be fortunate, as walking would become difficult for it. Then joining both hands, Natthu hurled the rock at the boar."
35,"The lantern flame in the pit flickered and the shadows on the wall swayed. The rock struck the boar."
36,"But it was unclear to Natthu where the rock had struck. The boar grunted loudly as the rock thumped against its snout."
37,"Natthu shrank back the moment he threw the rock, and stared at the boar. He was surprised to see the boar's half-closed eyes still gleaming, its snout resting on its forelimb."
38,"Suddenly the boar grunted and moved away from the back wall to the center of the shed, swaying left and right. Natthu retreated to a corner near the courtyard door."
39,"In the unsteady lantern light, the boar advanced like a dark mass. The rock had hit its head."
40,"Perhaps it was dazed and couldn't see properly. Natthu was afraid. The boar was definitely coming towards him."
41,"And it would definitely attack him. The rock didn't seem to have much effect on it."
42,"Natthu quickly opened the door and came out of the shed. Gasping for breath, he stood near the mortar beside the chaff scattered in the courtyard."
43,"Outside in the fresh air, he felt relieved. He had been troubled by the stench and stuffiness of the shed."
44,"The gentle breeze caressed his sweat-soaked body, filling him with boundless joy."
45,"For a moment, he felt as if he had been reborn! As if new life had entered his debilitated frame! 'What have I to do with this task? If the slaughterer didn't get the boar, so be it.'"
46,"'Tomorrow I'll hand in my resignation to Murad Ali and plead with folded hands. Your Honor, this is not my kind of work.'"
47,"'I cannot do this. Why ruin me? He'll make me suffer for a couple of days.'"
48,"'But I'll persuade him by touching his feet.' He stood still beside the mortar."
49,"The moon had risen and in its scattered light, the whole area seemed strange and mysterious."
50,"The dirt road through the village where bullock carts passed was now deserted - silent except for the clanging of bullock bells and rumbling of carts from the upstream villages all day."
51,"Deep ruts had formed on the road from the cartwheel tracks, the soil so pulverized that feet sank up to the ankles in dust."
52,"On the straight slope descending from the roadside to the fields, the small shrubs, babool plants and thorny babools were coated in dust, as if bathed in moonlight."
