1,"Dhritarashtra said: In the holy land of Kurukshetra, assembled to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do, Sanjaya?"
2,"Sanjaya said: Observing the Pandava army arrayed for battle, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke these words."
3,"He said: Behold, O Teacher, this mighty Pandava army arrayed by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple."
4,"Here in this army, there are heroic warriors like Bhurishrava, Arjuna, Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, the Maharatha."
5,"Dhrishtaketu, Cekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya, the best of men."
6,"Yudhamanyu, Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi, all are mighty warriors."
7,"Our army, O best of Brahmins, is distinctly known, while the Pandava army is also distinctly known. So, O Sanjaya, I wish to know who are prominent leaders on both sides."
8,"Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, victorious in war, Aswatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta, and many other heroes who have risked their lives for my cause."
9,"There are also many other heroes who are ready to give up their lives for my sake. They are armed with various weapons and are all skilled in warfare."
10,"Our strength is immeasurable, and we are well-protected by Bhishma, whereas the strength of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima, is limited."
11,"All of you, being in your respective positions on the battlefield, protect Bhishma alone."
12,"Then, joyfully, that great and grand old man, the grandfather Bhishma, roared as a lion does, and blew his conch loudly."
13,"After that, conches, kettledrums, bugles, trumpets, and horns were suddenly sounded, and the sound was tumultuous."
14,"On the other side, both Lord Krishna and Arjuna, standing in their magnificent chariot, blew their divine conches."
15,"Lord Krishna blew the Panchajanya conch, and Arjuna, the son of Pandu, blew the Devadatta conch. Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his large conch Paundra."
16,"King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya conch. "
17,"Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and Manipushpaka conches, respectively"
18,"The great archer Kasya, the valorous Sikhandi, the mighty charioteer Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, and the unconquered Satyaki all blew their respective conches."
19,"The tremendous sound echoed through heaven and earth, shattering the hearts of Duryodhana's party."
20,"At that time, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in his chariot and drawn by white horses, took up his bow and spoke these words to Lord Krishna."
21,"Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those present here"
22,"who desire to fight in this battlefield, and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms."
23,"Sanjaya said: O King, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to the grief-stricken Arjuna, who was despondent and fearful."
24,"The Blessed Lord said: O Partha, place My chariot between the two armies so that I may see those who are assembled here to fight, and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms."
25,"Bhishma, Drona, and all the other warriors of your side are arrayed here. Therefore, get up and gain fame as a conqueror of enemies."
26,"Seeing all the different divisions set in their proper places, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, in the midst of the two armies, told Lord Krishna these words."
27,"Arjuna said: O Krishna, seeing my kinsmen arrayed and desirous of battle, my limbs fail me, and my mouth is parched. My body trembles, and my hair stands on end."
28,"My bow, Gandiva, slips from my hand, and my skin intensely burns. My mind seems to be whirling. I am unable to stand steadily, and my resolve is wavering."
29,"I see adverse omens, O Kesava! I do not see any good in killing my own kinsmen in this battle."
30,"I do not desire victory, O Krishna, nor pleasures nor kingdoms. Of what avail is a kingdom, or happiness, or even life?"
31,"Those for whose sake we desire kingdoms, enjoyments, and pleasures are assembled here for battle, giving up their lives and wealth."
32,"Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives are present here."
33,"There are also many others ready to sacrifice their lives for my sake."
34,"I do not wish to kill them, even though they are ready to kill me, O Madhusudana, and destroyer of foes."
36,"I am not desirous of a kingdom, O Krishna, nor of heaven, nor of even lordship of the three worlds. What then is the need of such lordship, or enjoyments, or even life?"
37,"Those very people for whose sake we desire such enjoyments, kingdom, and pleasures are standing here in battle, giving up their lives and wealth."
38,"We are desirous of killing our own kinsmen, out of a longing for worldly gain, out of the sin of treachery."
39,"With the destruction of the dynasty, the eternal family traditions are vanishing, and when these religious principles are lost, impiety prevails."
40,"When impiety prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrishni, comes unwanted progeny."
41,"An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family traditions. The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down, because the offerings for them are entirely stopped."
42,"By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated."
43,"O Krishna, we have heard that living in hell is worse than being killed on the battlefield. So, I ask You to spare us from this."
44,"We are willing to give up the kingdom, our happiness, and our lives. But we cannot bear the sin of killing our own kinsmen."
