1,"What was the purpose of Tamas pushing the pig into the kitchen? He used to throw the wandering pigs into the garbage."
2,"He couldn't think of anything else. He kept picking up garbage and throwing it, and he kept banging the door of the broken pig in the courtyard."
3,"As the evening shadows began to fall, three pigs reached near the drains of dirty water, muddy puddles, and dust-filled bushes."
4,"At that time, a pig sniffed inside the courtyard and immediately caught and tied it up."
5,"Then he quickly ran and opened the door of the courtyard, and with his stick, he pushed the pig into the kitchen."
6,"The man from the pig farm searched for the pig but could not find it on that side, and when he heard the pig's squeals, he found the pig continuously putting garbage into the kitchen."
7,"When the garbage reached the courtyard, the pig was lost in it, and the squealing pig would often sit outside the courtyard door, confused and scared, staring at the door for a long time."
8,"Many times later, at night, the pig entered the courtyard. He saw that the garbage had been spread all over the courtyard."
9,"And this feels like a thorn in the flesh. Then he was drawn to the ugly, unattractive pig and began to feel troubled in his heart, wondering what kind of dirty work this pig had done."
10,"Then he felt like opening the door of the courtyard quickly and pushing the pig out."
11,"Now it was past midnight, and the pig was rummaging through the garbage as usual."
12,"The pig had burn marks on its skin, and there were several marks like scratches on its snout, and that was all."
13,"The pig was alive and awake inside the courtyard as before. Meanwhile, the pig was panting."
14,"His body was covered in sweat, and there seemed to be no way out of this mess. A few stars had fallen in the distant garden clock."
15,"The pig was startled and stood still. His gaze fell back on the pig. The pig had peed between the pieces of garbage."
16,"And this irritation made him scratch under the pig's chin with his right hand. He began to walk side by side with the pig towards the rice field."
17,"And at times, a shadow of a nightmare seemed to sway over him. He couldn't get a wink of sleep."
18,"Like before, he would sometimes bend down and stop the pig from sniffing the garbage, sometimes walk alongside the frightened pig, and sometimes"
19,"He would run with his stick. Like before, his thin, long tail would make curls like long thin ropes."
20,"It won't work anymore, the pig said, grinding his teeth, this disease is not under my control. This pig will satisfy me today."
21,"He tried again to catch the golden leg of the pig and push it. With his left hand, he slowly pushed the pig's leg down, inch by inch."
22,"The pig began to move its hind leg frantically as it felt the pressure from the left side. The pig started to hop backward instead of running forward."
23,"Whenever he tried to slap the pig's hind side, the pig would dodge each slap."
24,"Its eyes were still on the pig's dash. Now the pig was standing in front of him, facing him."
25,"In this position, catching its hind leg and pushing its back was impossible."
26,"The pig's bright red eyes were intoxicating. Who knows what it's thinking. But the pig seemed anxious."
27,"Both were exhausted, and the work that could have been done until evening was now impossible. Now the inspector's rank could be lowered, and if the work isn't done, what will Muraad Ali trust? This friend could turn into an enemy, stop the slaughter, drag them out, beat someone, astonish."
28,"The pig began to kick and jump. He knew deep down that holding the pig by its hind leg would make it restless and it would let go."
29,"Suddenly, the pig woke up. For no apparent reason, it began to squirm."
30,"He said, 'Not this, not that,' and quickly grabbed a large stone from under the rock. Lifting the stone, he moved straight toward the pig."
31,"He lifted both hands and placed the stone on its head for a moment. The pig's dash was still on its front leg. He smelled its sweat."
32,"Its red eyes were twinkling. Its small tail behind its back was constantly moving."
33,"In this precarious situation, if the stone were to land straight on its body, it might do something or the pig might injure some part of the pig."
34,"If one leg breaks, it will be advantageous; it will become difficult to handle. Then, pulling both hands, Nattu hit the pig on its back with the stone."
35,"The light of the torch in the cage flickered, and a shadow fell on the pig. The stone hit the pig."
36,"Nattu felt dizzy, but wasn't sure where he had hit. The pig squealed loudly as he struck it with all his might."
37,"Nattu suddenly moved back, and the pig began to wobble. Looking at Nattu, the pig's half-shut eyes were twinkling, and it moved its dash to its front leg."
38,"Suddenly, the pig dodged and tried to run backward. It swayed from side to side. Nattu, panicked, ran towards the open door in the courtyard."
39,"In the unstable light of the lamp, the pig seemed to be moving forward like a black ball. The stone had hit its head."
40,"He might be able to save himself by running towards his house and not looking back. Nattu got scared. The pig is surely moving towards him."
41,"And this definitely won't affect him. It didn't seem like anything had an impact on the stone."
42,"Suddenly, the door opened and he rushed out. In which form did he go, this old man, and in the courtyard, he got stuck on the prickly bush near the channel."
43,"Upon reaching outside, he felt relief in the fresh air. He was troubled by the prickles and the stench."
44,"The cool touch of the breeze on his body gave him immense pleasure."
45,"In just a moment, he felt as if he no longer wanted to live! His limp, lifeless body didn't breathe again! Why should I take on this responsibility? If the sculpture is not perfect, then it's not my fault."
46,"I handed over the note to Murad Ali yesterday and apologized. This is not my fault."
47,"I can't do this job. What do I have to lose? It will take two days."
48,"I put my hand on his knee to appease him. He was still standing stubbornly near the channel."
49,"The moon had risen, and in the moonlight, everything around him seemed mysterious and secretive."
50,"The glass road, which was bustling with cars during the day, was silent now. Calm and quiet, all day he heard the clattering of the cars coming from the northern villages."
51,"He fell on the road from his horse. And the dust was so fine that when he placed his foot on it, the dust rose up to his knees."
52,"At the edge of the road, towards the field, on the steep slope, small trees, and the ends of boards and the sharp edges of boards were covered in dust. And this was visible on a moonlit night."
