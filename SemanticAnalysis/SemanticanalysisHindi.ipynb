', 'After a long patient wait, when it was finally dark he ventured back into the room. In the dim, wavering light of the clay lamp he saw that the garbage lay scattered all over the floor, filling the room with its stench.', 'Then his eyes fell on the big, powerful brute. It looked huge and forbidding. His heart sank- He felt like flinging the door open and letting the pig out.', 'Still, he felt like flinging the door open and letting the pig out.', 'More than half the night was gone and the pig was still very much alive, still gobbling up garbage.

', 'Nathu got up in alarm; glared at the pig. Planting its feet on a heap of garbage, the pig urinated and then resumed its -walk, round and round the room.', \"And it angrily moved from the middle of the room to walk close to the right wall. The lamp's flame started flickering again.\", 'And the shadows began swaying on the wall repeatedly like some nightmare. There was no change in the situation at all.  ', 'Its eyes fixed on the floor, the pig would trot along the wall as if searching for something. Then it would suddenly squeal and move away.', 'Its small tail curled over its back like a whiplash. Rheum, oozing from its left eye, had trickled down to its snout.', \"'I wish I knew what to do!' Nathu thought in angry frustration. This brute is going to be the death of me.'\", \"He decided to make one more attempt to catch hold of the pig's hind legs and roll it over on the floor. Holding the knife aloft in his left hand, he cautiously moved to the middle of the room.\", 'The pig, reaching the end of the right wall, turned and started walking along the left side of the room. Instead of running away on seeing Nathu coming towards it, it turned and started moving towards Nathu.', \"Once the pig grunted as if to charge at Nathu, but didn't really. Nathu started retreating step by step.\", \"His eyes were still fixed on the pig's snout. The pig was now right in front of him, moving menacingly towards him.\", 'In this situation, it had become impossible for him to catch its hind legs and roll it over on its back.', \"The pig's tiny red eyes were bloodshot. Who knew what it might do? But Nathu was getting desperate.\", \"Two o'clock had struck and what could not be achieved from the evening till now, how would it be possible before dawn? The sweeper's cart could come any time and if the job was not done, what about Murad Ali? From a friend he could turn into an enemy, stop giving him hides, have him ejected from his hovel, get someone to beat him up, harass him.\", \"Nathu's hands and feet went limp. He knew in his heart that if he grabbed the pig by its hind legs, it would struggle violently or lash out to free itself from his grip.\", 'Suddenly Nathu flared up, without any apparent reason, as if a spark had been kindled in his entire being.', 'Me or the pig, he muttered and quickly turned and picked up a large slab lying near the alcove. Holding the slab aloft, he planted himself in the middle of the room.', 'Holding the stone slab over his head, he stood stiffly erect, watching the animal. The pig had lost interest in him and was sniffing at the rind of a water melon, its red eyes blinking, its small tail waving at its back.', 'If the animal stood still like that, the slab could cause it considerable injury and it would be slowed down effectively.', 'If the slab hit it squarely, it was bound to inflict some injury and break a leg or some other part of its body.', 'Even if one of its legs broke, it would be a blessing in disguise as its movement would be impeded. With both hands Nathu took aim and flung the slab at the pig.', 'The lamp wavered; the shadows on the wall shook. The slab hit the pig', \"but Nathu could not tell on which part of its body for he had turned his face away as he let go of the slab. The pig grunted loudly as the slab hit it. But, to Nathu's surprise, the pig still seemed unhurt in any significant way.\", \"Nathu had turned away the moment he released the slab and was now peering at the pig. He was amazed to see that the pig's half-closed eyes were still blinking and its snout was still resting on its front legs.\", 'Suddenly, the pig grunted again, and walked to the middle of the room, its belly swaying from side to side. Nathu stationed himself at the door opening into the courtyard.', 'Under the wavering light of the lamp he could see the pig, a solid black mass, walking ponderously towards him. It looked as though the slab had hit it on its head and, feeling dazed, it was having difficulty seeing.', 'Nathu felt scared. Was the pig going to charge him? It could bite him, maul him badly.', 'Otherwise, the scene had undergone no significant change.', 'Quickly opening the door he slipped out of the room.', 'As the wind blew against his perspiring body he felt alive again.', 'The streaming wind came as a relief.', 'For a moment he felt as if he had been reborn, his limp, flagging body had been infused with new life.', \"Tomorrow I'll return the five-rupee note to Murad Ali and folds my hands before him.

For two days he will go about grim-faced.  \", \"On the third day I'll place my head at his feet and he'll relent.\", 'The moon had come out, softening and rearranging the perspective of the familiar scene around him.', 'Across the road, wild berry trees, thorny bushes and cactus plants grew along the steep slopes that descended to the maidan, beyond which lay the graveyard.', \"Throughout the day, one could hear the creaking of the bullock carts and the jingle of bells around the bullocks' necks as the carts passed along the din road. But now the road lay deserted and quiet.\", 'Behind the graveyard stood the huts inhabited by low caste grave diggers.', 'Bringing the wild boar inside the shed was no easy task. He had seen the wandering boar poking its snout in the garbage.', \"He couldn't think of anything else. He kept picking up garbage from a pit and making a heap outside the broken shed near the door in the courtyard.\", 'As the evening shadows lengthened, three boars wandering near the pools of dirty water, piles of husk, and bushes covered in dust came that way.', 'Just then, one of the boars sniffing the garbage entered the courtyard, and Natthu quickly shut the gate.', 'Then he ran and opened the shed door on the other side of the courtyard and drove the boar inside with his stick.', 'Afraid that the swineherd might come looking for the boar in that direction and hear its grunts, Natthu kept tossing garbage into the shed.', 'Once the garbage was inside the shed, the boar disappeared into it, and Natthu sat outside the shed, smoking beedis and waiting for dusk to fall.', 'Much later, as night began to fall, Natthu entered the shed. In the flickering light of the lantern, he saw that the garbage was strewn all over the shed.', 'And a rotten, pungent smell emanated from it. Then, seeing the huge, ugly boar, his heart sank, and he regretted taking on this dirty, dangerous task.', 'Still, he felt like opening the shed door and pushing the boar out.', 'Now it was past midnight, and the boar lay wallowing in the garbage.', \"There were bloodstains on its snout, a couple of gashes on its trunk, and wounds from its tusks on its own leg, that's all.\", 'The boar was alive and present inside the shed, while Natthu was panting.', \"His body was drenched in sweat, and there seemed no way out of this ordeal. Two strokes rang out from the clock in the Sheikh's garden in the distance.\", 'Natthu stood up in alarm. His gaze fell again on the boar. The boar had urinated amidst the garbage scraps.', 'Disgusted, it moved away from the center of the shed towards the right side wall. The lantern flame flickered again.', 'The shadows swayed on the walls like a nightmare. The situation remained unchanged.', 'The boar kept lowering its head, now sniffing the garbage with its tusk, now walking alongside the wall, and now', 'grunting and running alongside the wall. As before, its thin long tail kept coiling and uncoiling like a slender rope.', \"'This won't do,' Natthu said through gritted teeth, 'this disease is beyond my control. This boar will devour me today.'\", 'He thought he should try grabbing its leg again and toppling it over. Raising the knife in his left hand, he walked slowly into the center of the shed.', 'The boar reached the far right corner wall and began circling close to the left side. Seeing Natthu approach, instead of fleeing, it turned towards him.', 'The boar even feinted an attack on Natthu once. Natthu took a step back.', \"His eyes were still fixed on the boar's tusks. Now the boar was right in front of him, charging at him.\", 'In this situation, it became impossible to grab its hind leg, pull it back and topple it over.', \"There was frenzy in the boar's narrow red eyes. Who knows what it might do. But Natthu was getting anxious.\", \"It was two o'clock, and the task that could not be completed since the evening, how would it be done by daybreak? The landlord's messenger could arrive anytime, and if the work was not done, what trust could there be in Murad Ali? He could turn from friend to foe, stop providing hides, evict him from the shed, have him beaten, harass him.\", \"Natthu's hands and feet began to tremble. He knew that if he grabbed the boar's hind leg, it would struggle or lash out and free itself.\", 'Suddenly Natthu felt emboldened. For no apparent reason, it seemed a surge of energy coursed through his body.', \"'Not me, not this,' he said and quickly turned to pick up the large rock lying near the pit. Holding the rock, he went straight to the center of the shed.\", \"He paused for a moment, holding the rock above his head with both hands. The boar's snout was still on its forelimbs. It was sniffing the burlap sack.\", 'Its red eyes were gleaming. Its small tail was constantly wagging behind its back.', \"If it didn't move and the rock landed squarely on its body, it would definitely hit somewhere and at least fracture one of its limbs.\", 'Even if just one leg broke, it would be fortunate, as walking would become difficult for it. Then joining both hands, Natthu hurled the rock at the boar.', 'The lantern flame in the pit flickered and the shadows on the wall swayed. The rock struck the boar.', 'But it was unclear to Natthu where the rock had struck. The boar grunted loudly as the rock thumped against its snout.', \"Natthu shrank back the moment he threw the rock, and stared at the boar. He was surprised to see the boar's half-closed eyes still gleaming, its snout resting on its forelimb.\", 'Suddenly the boar grunted and moved away from the back wall to the center of the shed, swaying left and right. Natthu retreated to a corner near the courtyard door.', 'In the unsteady lantern light, the boar advanced like a dark mass. The rock had hit its head.', \"Perhaps it was dazed and couldn't see properly. Natthu was afraid. The boar was definitely coming towards him.\", \"And it would definitely attack him. The rock didn't seem to have much effect on it.\", 'Natthu quickly opened the door and came out of the shed. Gasping for breath, he stood near the mortar beside the chaff scattered in the courtyard.', 'Outside in the fresh air, he felt relieved. He had been troubled by the stench and stuffiness of the shed.', 'The gentle breeze caressed his sweat-soaked body, filling him with boundless joy.', \"For a moment, he felt as if he had been reborn! As if new life had entered his debilitated frame! 'What have I to do with this task? If the slaughterer didn't get the boar, so be it.'\", \"'Tomorrow I'll hand in my resignation to Murad Ali and plead with folded hands. Your Honor, this is not my kind of work.'\", \"'I cannot do this. Why ruin me? He'll make me suffer for a couple of days.'\", \"'But I'll persuade him by touching his feet.' He stood still beside the mortar.\", 'The moon had risen and in its scattered light, the whole area seemed strange and mysterious.', 'The dirt road through the village where bullock carts passed was now deserted - silent except for the clanging of bullock bells and rumbling of carts from the upstream villages all day.', 'Deep ruts had formed on the road from the cartwheel tracks, the soil so pulverized that feet sank up to the ankles in dust.', 'On the straight slope descending from the roadside to the fields, the small shrubs, babool plants and thorny babools were coated in dust, as if bathed in moonlight.', 'What simple task did Tamas the piglet have to perform? He used to wander around and see the piglets wallowing in the garbage.', 'Nothing else occurred to him. He kept lifting the garbage from the corner, bringing it to the doorstep, and placing the garbage bag there.', 'During twilight, when the shadows began to lengthen, three pigs would arrive near the water trough, which was filled with dirty water, mud and dust.', 'At that moment, one pig would sniff inside the trough, and immediately, it would grab the door of the garbage room and close it.', 'Then, swiftly, he would open the door to the pigsty and push the piglet inside, using his own stick.', 'The man from the pigsty would search for the pig in the garbage room, but it wouldn’t come to the side where the pigsty was. The piglet’s squeals went unheard, and it continued its risky work.', 'When the pig entered the garbage room, it meant that the pig had lost its way, and the blind darkness outside the door was terrifying. The piglet kept pushing the door, trying to escape.', 'Many times, late at night, when the wind was blowing harder, the piglet would sneak into the garbage room. In the middle of the dancing flames, he realized that the garbage was scattered all over.', 'And from this, a peculiar smell like rotten eggs emanated. The heavily built, handsome piglet looked at it and felt a mixture of curiosity and disgust. He wondered what dangerous work he had undertaken.', 'At that moment, he decided to quickly open the door of the garbage room and push the pig outside.', 'By now, the night was darker than ever, and the piglet was engulfed in the thick smoke of the garbage.', 'His body was covered in soot, and from this chaos, no path seemed visible. He stumbled upon a couple of stones near the garden’s fence.', 'The piglet, like before, was alive and awake inside the garbage room. Whenever the piglet snorted, it was as if he was breathing in the same foul air.', 'His body was sticky and slippery. He couldn’t find any way out of this mess. In the distant garden clock, the hands were pointing to two.', 'Nathu, feeling anxious, stood still. His gaze fell on the pig again. The pig was urinating intermittently between the pieces of garbage.', 'And due to this uneasiness, he started moving towards the pigsty, walking alongside the wall. Occasionally, he would glance back, as if he was afraid of some nightmare. He couldn’t find a way out.', 'Like before, the piglet was alive and awake inside the garbage room. Whenever the piglet snorted, it was as if he was breathing in the same foul air.', 'His body was sticky and slippery. He couldn’t find any way out of this mess. Near the garden clock, the hands were pointing to two.', 'Nervously, the piglet stood still. His eyes…', 'Now, he decided to quickly grab the piglet’s leg and try to pull him out. He tried to lift the piglet’s hind legs, but the piglet resisted, pulling back with all its strength.', 'He thought of pushing the piglet’s hind legs towards the door. He tried to untangle the piglet’s long, thin tail, which was like a twisted rope.', 'The piglet refused to move, saying, ‘No, I won’t go. This disease is not mine. The pig will eat me today.’', 'So, he decided to quickly grab the piglet’s leg and push him outside. But the piglet resisted, making it impossible to lift him.', 'His eyes were fixed on the piglet’s tail, which was hanging down. Now, the piglet was looking at him with the same fear in his eyes.', 'In this situation, it seemed impossible to pull the piglet’s hind legs towards him. He tried to lift the piglet’s tail, but it slipped away.', 'The pig’s small, red eyes were intoxicated. Who knows what it was thinking. But Nathu was restless.', 'Both his legs were trembling, and the work he had left since evening couldn’t be completed until now. Could it be done in this state? Maybe Jamadar’s whip could motivate him, and if the work wasn’t done, he could rely on Murad Ali’s show. Even an enemy could become a friend, tie the leather straps, pull from the harness, make someone work, surprise them.', 'Nathu’s hands and feet began to falter. He knew in his heart that if he tried to grab the pig’s hind legs, it would resist and slip away.', 'Suddenly, Nathu stood up. Without any clear reason, he felt a strange sensation in every part of his body.', 'Where am I? No, not this, he thought. Saying this, he quickly lifted a large stone lying behind the pigsty. Holding the stone, he reached the piglet directly.', 'He lifted the stone above the pig’s head for a moment. Even now, the piglet’s hind legs were on the ground. He sniffed the piglet’s tail.', 'His eyes were blinking rapidly. Behind him, the piglet’s small tail was still wagging.', 'In this uncertain situation, if the stone directly hit the pig’s body, it would either hurt or break something. Then, whether it was the pig or some part of the pig, it would definitely get injured.', 'If a stone breaks, it’s a gain. It will be difficult to move before it starts working. Then, Nathu grabbed both the pig’s legs and pushed the piglet outside.', 'In the dim light of the lantern, the piglet’s eyes flickered, and it fell on the ground.', 'Nathu felt darkness, but he still didn’t know where he was. The piglet was still sniffing and moving its hind legs.', \"The stone that the donkey threw hit him right behind. And the pig turned its head to see. The donkey, upon seeing the pig, felt a sudden shock. The pig's left eye was blinking rapidly, and it had scratched its forehead with the next leg.\", 'Suddenly, the pig was startled and, from behind, it came running towards the door. It swung back and forth. The donkey, standing in the courtyard, saw the door open towards the pig.', 'In the flickering light of the lamp, the pig appeared like a black shadow advancing. The stone had hit its head.', \"And perhaps it had also hit its tail. But it didn't seem to show any visible signs. The donkey got scared. The pig was definitely moving its hind legs forward.\", \"And surely it must have been hurt. There seemed to be no effect on the stone's surface.\", 'The donkey quickly opened the door and rushed out. In what shape did it find the pig? It was huddled and standing near the prickly pear cactus in the courtyard.', 'Outside, in the fresh air, it felt relieved. The pig was bothered by the dust and the stench.', \"Next to it, the donkey's body experienced boundless joy from the gentle touch of the breeze.\", \"For a moment, it felt as if it hadn't come back to life since the New Year! In its lifeless body, breath hadn't returned. Did this deed go in vain? The solitary one hadn't found the pig, so it hadn't found my strength either.\", 'I will go to Murad Ali tomorrow, collect the note from the cashier, and fold my hands. This is not my job.', 'This work cannot be done by me. What should I do? It will be kept for two days.', 'I will place my hand on its forehead and pacify it. It was standing still near the prickly pear cactus.', 'The moon had risen, and in the moonlight, it appeared mysterious and surrounded by the shimmering moon.', \"The dusty, unpaved road that stretched out from the village was deserted at this time. Silent and calm, the donkeys' hooves clattered against the rough and dusty ground all day.\", \"From the trees along the road, it descended into the open field. The small, thorny bushes and the boards tied with ropes were echoing the sound of the donkeys' hooves.\", 'Crossing the field, it reached the straight path on the other side of the road. The narrow, thorny bushes and the boards with sharp edges were covered in dust, and the moonlit night witnessed it all.', 'What was the purpose of Tamas pushing the pig into the kitchen? He used to throw the wandering pigs into the garbage.', \"He couldn't think of anything else. He kept picking up garbage and throwing it, and he kept banging the door of the broken pig in the courtyard.\", 'As the evening shadows began to fall, three pigs reached near the drains of dirty water, muddy puddles, and dust-filled bushes.', 'At that time, a pig sniffed inside the courtyard and immediately caught and tied it up.', 'Then he quickly ran and opened the door of the courtyard, and with his stick, he pushed the pig into the kitchen.', \"The man from the pig farm searched for the pig but could not find it on that side, and when he heard the pig's squeals, he found the pig continuously putting garbage into the kitchen.\", 'When the garbage reached the courtyard, the pig was lost in it, and the squealing pig would often sit outside the courtyard door, confused and scared, staring at the door for a long time.', 'Many times later, at night, the pig entered the courtyard. He saw that the garbage had been spread all over the courtyard.', 'And this feels like a thorn in the flesh. Then he was drawn to the ugly, unattractive pig and began to feel troubled in his heart, wondering what kind of dirty work this pig had done.', 'Then he felt like opening the door of the courtyard quickly and pushing the pig out.', 'Now it was past midnight, and the pig was rummaging through the garbage as usual.', 'The pig had burn marks on its skin, and there were several marks like scratches on its snout, and that was all.', 'The pig was alive and awake inside the courtyard as before. Meanwhile, the pig was panting.', 'His body was covered in sweat, and there seemed to be no way out of this mess. A few stars had fallen in the distant garden clock.', 'The pig was startled and stood still. His gaze fell back on the pig. The pig had peed between the pieces of garbage.', \"And this irritation made him scratch under the pig's chin with his right hand. He began to walk side by side with the pig towards the rice field.\", \"And at times, a shadow of a nightmare seemed to sway over him. He couldn't get a wink of sleep.\", 'Like before, he would sometimes bend down and stop the pig from sniffing the garbage, sometimes walk alongside the frightened pig, and sometimes', 'He would run with his stick. Like before, his thin, long tail would make curls like long thin ropes.', \"It won't work anymore, the pig said, grinding his teeth, this disease is not under my control. This pig will satisfy me today.\", \"He tried again to catch the golden leg of the pig and push it. With his left hand, he slowly pushed the pig's leg down, inch by inch.\", 'The pig began to move its hind leg frantically as it felt the pressure from the left side. The pig started to hop backward instead of running forward.', \"Whenever he tried to slap the pig's hind side, the pig would dodge each slap.\", \"Its eyes were still on the pig's dash. Now the pig was standing in front of him, facing him.\", 'In this position, catching its hind leg and pushing its back was impossible.', \"The pig's bright red eyes were intoxicating. Who knows what it's thinking. But the pig seemed anxious.\", \"Both were exhausted, and the work that could have been done until evening was now impossible. Now the inspector's rank could be lowered, and if the work isn't done, what will Muraad Ali trust? This friend could turn into an enemy, stop the slaughter, drag them out, beat someone, astonish.\", 'The pig began to kick and jump. He knew deep down that holding the pig by its hind leg would make it restless and it would let go.', 'Suddenly, the pig woke up. For no apparent reason, it began to squirm.', \"He said, 'Not this, not that,' and quickly grabbed a large stone from under the rock. Lifting the stone, he moved straight toward the pig.\", \"He lifted both hands and placed the stone on its head for a moment. The pig's dash was still on its front leg. He smelled its sweat.\", 'Its red eyes were twinkling. Its small tail behind its back was constantly moving.', 'In this precarious situation, if the stone were to land straight on its body, it might do something or the pig might injure some part of the pig.', 'If one leg breaks, it will be advantageous; it will become difficult to handle. Then, pulling both hands, Nattu hit the pig on its back with the stone.', 'The light of the torch in the cage flickered, and a shadow fell on the pig. The stone hit the pig.', \"Nattu felt dizzy, but wasn't sure where he had hit. The pig squealed loudly as he struck it with all his might.\", \"Nattu suddenly moved back, and the pig began to wobble. Looking at Nattu, the pig's half-shut eyes were twinkling, and it moved its dash to its front leg.\", 'Suddenly, the pig dodged and tried to run backward. It swayed from side to side. Nattu, panicked, ran towards the open door in the courtyard.', 'In the unstable light of the lamp, the pig seemed to be moving forward like a black ball. The stone had hit its head.', 'He might be able to save himself by running towards his house and not looking back. Nattu got scared. The pig is surely moving towards him.', \"And this definitely won't affect him. It didn't seem like anything had an impact on the stone.\", 'Suddenly, the door opened and he rushed out. In which form did he go, this old man, and in the courtyard, he got stuck on the prickly bush near the channel.', 'Upon reaching outside, he felt relief in the fresh air. He was troubled by the prickles and the stench.', 'The cool touch of the breeze on his body gave him immense pleasure.', \"In just a moment, he felt as if he no longer wanted to live! His limp, lifeless body didn't breathe again! Why should I take on this responsibility? If the sculpture is not perfect, then it's not my fault.\", 'I handed over the note to Murad Ali yesterday and apologized. This is not my fault.', \"I can't do this job. What do I have to lose? It will take two days.\", 'I put my hand on his knee to appease him. He was still standing stubbornly near the channel.', 'The moon had risen, and in the moonlight, everything around him seemed mysterious and secretive.', 'The glass road, which was bustling with cars during the day, was silent now. Calm and quiet, all day he heard the clattering of the cars coming from the northern villages.', 'He fell on the road from his horse. And the dust was so fine that when he placed his foot on it, the dust rose up to his knees.', 'At the edge of the road, towards the field, on the steep slope, small trees, and the ends of boards and the sharp edges of boards were covered in dust. And this was visible on a moonlit night.', 'Where was it even an easy task to bring the Tamas pig inside the room? He had seen the wandering pig feeding its mouth in the garbage.', 'He did not understand anything else. He kept picking up the garbage from one of the scraps and kept piling the garbage outside this dilapidated room by the door in the courtyard.', 'When the shadows of the evening began to bend, three boars came to that side, circling near puddles of dirty water, heaps of dung, and bushes full of dust.', 'Just then one of the pigs came inside the courtyard smelling the garbage and Natyu quickly closed the door.', 'Then running swiftly he opened the door of the chamber beyond the courtyard, and with his stick drove the boar into the chamber.', 'The man of the piggery was looking for the pig, so that he did not come to that side, and he did not hear the cry of the pig, he kept picking up the garbage and throwing it in the room.', 'The garbage reached the room, so the pig got lost in it, and Natthu was surprised and sat outside the room for several times, beating the beedoo and watching for darkness.', 'Many times later Natthu entered the room as night fell. In the medium dancing light of the lamp he saw the rubbish scattered all over the room.', 'And from it comes a rotten smell like cowdung. Just then, seeing that huge ugly pig, his heart sank and he began to regret in his heart why he took this dirty and dangerous job.', 'Right then it occurred to him to quickly open the door of the room and push the pig out.', 'It was now more than half past midnight and the pig was smoldering in the middle of the waste.', \"There were bloodstains on the floor, and a couple of bruises on the pig's snare, and on its own leg were the wounds of the pig's butt, and that was it.\", 'The pig was inside the room, alive and awake as before. While the nostril was breathing.', \"His body was drenched in perspiration and there was no way out of this mess. Far away the clock in the Sheikh's garden struck two.\", 'Natthu got up in a panic. His eyes again fell on the pig. The pig had urinated again while standing in the middle of a piece of garbage.', 'And that Khijai moved from the middle of the room and began to walk near the right-hand rice. The flame of the lamp began to flicker again.', 'And the shadow began to sway again and again on the ceiling like a nightmare. The situation did not change at all.', 'The pig, as before, lowered his head, sometimes stopping to smell the garbage from the dacha, sometimes walking along the banks and sometimes', 'The screech started running along my wall. As before, its thin long tail curled and unfurled like a thin long tail.', \"It won't be like this, Natthu said, gritting his teeth,This disease is not under my control. This pig will eat me today.\", \"It happened that once again I caught hold of the pig's leg and tried to turn it upside down. He raised the knife in his left hand and walked slowly in the middle of the room.\", 'The boar reached the end of the right hand wall and began to walk close to the body on the left side. Seeing Natthu rushing towards him, instead of running away, Natthu turned and started to attack.', 'Once the pig snorted as if to lunge at the nostril but it did. The nostril began to take a step back.', \"His eyes were still fixed like a pig's sty. Now the pig was right in front of him, charging towards him.\", 'In this position it was impossible to hold his hind leg and pull him backwards and turn him over on his back.', \"The pig's tiny red eyes were full of lust. Who knew what he was doing. But Natthu was getting anxious.\", \"It was two o'clock and the work which could not be done since last evening till now, how will it be done by the time the po bursts? The Jamadar's line can come at any time and if the work is not done, trust Murad Ali's show? It has become a friend and an enemy.Sit down, stop flogging, put the knife out of the room, beat someone, harass.\", \"Nuthu's limbs began to flinch. He knew in his heart that if he caught the pig by its hind legs, it would bite or jump and free itself.\", 'Suddenly, the nose rose. For no apparent reason, it felt like a pain in the body.', 'Saying,Not me, not this, he immediately turned back and picked up a big stone from the bottom of the cave. Picking up the stone, he went straight to the middle of the room.', \"Lifting the stone with both hands above his head, he paused for a moment. The boar's scar was still on its foreleg. It was sniffing the bark of the teat.\", 'His red eyes were twinkling. His small tail was constantly behind his back.', 'If it does not move and the stone hits its body directly, it will run somewhere and somewhere, and some part of the pig will be crushed.', 'Even if one tog is broken, Ganimat, his walking will be more difficult than before. Then Natthu, folding both his hands, hurled the stone at the boar.', 'The flame of the lamp placed in the gokhala flickered and shadows rose on the floor. The stone hit the pig.', \"Tamas Lato, but Natthu didn't know exactly where it hit. The boar gave a loud shriek and the stone fell to the floor with a crash.\", \"Nattu fell back as soon as he had thrown the stone. And stared at the pig. Natthu was surprised to see that the pig's half-lidded eyes were blinking and its scar was still attached to its front leg.\", ' suddenly the boar snorted and moved from the back to the middle of the room. It was swaying left and right. A core, leaning forward, moved towards the door opening into the courtyard and stopped. ', 'In the flickering light of the lamp the boar was advancing like a black mass. The stone fell on its head.', 'Ane Lauidhai, he may have got a fever and cannot see well. Natthu is afraid. The boar is coming forward.', 'And that need would bite him. The stone did not seem to have any effect on him.', 'Natthu quickly opened the door and went out of the room. In which figure the life was slaughtered, he muttered and stood near the stone slab on the porch in the courtyard.', ' Reaching outside he was relieved in the fresh air. He was disturbed by the stuffiness and stench of the room.', 'His sweaty body felt boundless joy at the gentle touch of the air.', 'For a while he felt as if he had not started living anew! Life had not come back to his limp dead body! What do I have to do with this work? If Salotari did not get the pig, then it was not for me.', 'I will put the pouch note in front of Murad Ali tomorrow and join hands. This is not my job sir.', \"I can't do this job. What is I going to waste? He will keep his mouth open for two days.\", 'I will put my hand on his knee and persuade him. He stood still by the katha.', 'The moon had risen and in the sprinkled moonlight the whole region around it seemed strange and mysterious.', 'The unpaved bullock road through Hasame fell asleep at this time. Silent and quiet, all day long the clatter of bullock-carts from the northern villages and the jingling of the bells tied to the oxen could be heard over it.', 'The road was deeply rutted by his treads. And his soil was ground so fine that as soon as he set foot on it, his feet sank into the dust up to his knees.', 'On the steep slope that led down to the plain across the road were small bushes and brambles and thorny boards strewn with dust. And washed in the moonlit night.']\n"
