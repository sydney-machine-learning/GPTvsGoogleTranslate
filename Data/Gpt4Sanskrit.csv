1,"Dhritarashtra said: In the holy land of Kurukshetra, assembled together, desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do, O Sanjaya?"
2,"Sanjaya said: O King! Having seen the Pandava army arrayed in battle formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke the following words."
3,"Behold, O teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple."
4,"Here in this army, there are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna; there are also great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, the maharatha (great chariot-warrior)."
5,"There are also great, heroic, powerful fighters like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant Kasi king, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya—all the best of men."
6,"The mighty Yudhamanyu, the brave Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi—all these are maharathas."
7,"But for your information, O best of the twice-born, I will tell you about the captains of my army, who are especially qualified to lead."
8,"There are personalities like yourself, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta called Bhurishrava, who are always victorious in battle."
9,"There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science."
10,"Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Bhishma, whereas the strength of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima, is limited."
11,"All of you, being demigods, are undoubtedly more powerful than the Pandavas. But our victory will depend on Bhishma. Therefore, all of you should give your full support to Bhishma."
12,"Then Bhishma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conch shell very loudly, making a sound like the roar of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy."
13,"After that, the conch shells, drums, bugles, trumpets, and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous."
14,"On the other side, both Lord Krishna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conch shells."
15,"Lord Krishna blew His conch shell called Pancajanya, and Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta. Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conch shell called Paundra."
16,"King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch shell, the Anantavijaya, Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and Manipushpaka, and the great archer Arjuna blew the Devadatta."
17,"The mighty-armed Bhimasena, the voracious eater, blew the great conch shell Paundra; and Nakula, the great chariot-warrior, blew the Sughosha."
18,"Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Drupada, blew his conch shell, the Anantavijaya; and the king of the Cedis and the son of Subhadra, the great car-warrior Abhimanyu, blew his conch shell, the Devadatta."
19,"The blowing of these different conch shells became uproarious. Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra."
20,"At that time, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanuman, took up his bow"
21,"""O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so I may see those present here, who desire to fight"
22,""and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms."""
22,"Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra."
23,"So that I may observe those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by engaging in battle."
24,"Sanjaya said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties."
25,"In the presence of Bhisma, Drona, and all the other chieftains of the world, the Lord said, ""Just behold, Partha, all the Kurus assembled here."""
26,"There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his father-in-law and well-wishers."
27,"When the son of Kunti, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus."
28,"Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up."
29,"My whole body is trembling, and my hair is standing on end. My bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning."
30,"I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Krishna, killer of the Kesi demon."
31,"I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Krishna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness."
32,"O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness, or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield?"
33,"O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me?"
34,"O maintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth. What pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarashtra?"
36,"Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra and our friends. What should we gain, O Krishna, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?"
37,"O Janardana, although these men, overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one's family or quarreling with friends"
38,"why should we, who can see the crime in destroying a family, engage in these acts of sin?"
39,"With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion."
40,"When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Krishna, the women of the family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrishni, comes unwanted progeny."
41,"An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down because the performances for offering them food and water are entirely stopped."
42,"By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated."
43,"O Krishna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell."
44,"Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts, driven by the desire for royal happiness."
45,"I would consider it better for the sons of Dhritarashtra to kill me unarmed and unresisting, rather than fight with them."
46,"Sanjaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief."
