1,"Where was it even an easy task to bring the Tamas pig inside the room? He had seen the wandering pig feeding its mouth in the garbage."
2,"He did not understand anything else. He kept picking up the garbage from one of the scraps and kept piling the garbage outside this dilapidated room by the door in the courtyard."
3,"When the shadows of the evening began to bend, three boars came to that side, circling near puddles of dirty water, heaps of dung, and bushes full of dust."
4,"Just then one of the pigs came inside the courtyard smelling the garbage and Natyu quickly closed the door."
5,"Then running swiftly he opened the door of the chamber beyond the courtyard, and with his stick drove the boar into the chamber."
6,"The man of the piggery was looking for the pig, so that he did not come to that side, and he did not hear the cry of the pig, he kept picking up the garbage and throwing it in the room."
7,"The garbage reached the room, so the pig got lost in it, and Natthu was surprised and sat outside the room for several times, beating the beedoo and watching for darkness."
8,"Many times later Natthu entered the room as night fell. In the medium dancing light of the lamp he saw the rubbish scattered all over the room."
9,"And from it comes a rotten smell like cowdung. Just then, seeing that huge ugly pig, his heart sank and he began to regret in his heart why he took this dirty and dangerous job."
10,"Right then it occurred to him to quickly open the door of the room and push the pig out."
11,"It was now more than half past midnight and the pig was smoldering in the middle of the waste."
12,"There were bloodstains on the floor, and a couple of bruises on the pig's snare, and on its own leg were the wounds of the pig's butt, and that was it."
13,"The pig was inside the room, alive and awake as before. While the nostril was breathing."
14,"His body was drenched in perspiration and there was no way out of this mess. Far away the clock in the Sheikh's garden struck two."
15,"Natthu got up in a panic. His eyes again fell on the pig. The pig had urinated again while standing in the middle of a piece of garbage."
16,"And that Khijai moved from the middle of the room and began to walk near the right-hand rice. The flame of the lamp began to flicker again."
17,"And the shadow began to sway again and again on the ceiling like a nightmare. The situation did not change at all."
18,"The pig, as before, lowered his head, sometimes stopping to smell the garbage from the dacha, sometimes walking along the banks and sometimes"
19,"The screech started running along my wall. As before, its thin long tail curled and unfurled like a thin long tail."
20,"It won't be like this, Natthu said, gritting his teeth,This disease is not under my control. This pig will eat me today."
21,"It happened that once again I caught hold of the pig's leg and tried to turn it upside down. He raised the knife in his left hand and walked slowly in the middle of the room."
22,"The boar reached the end of the right hand wall and began to walk close to the body on the left side. Seeing Natthu rushing towards him, instead of running away, Natthu turned and started to attack."
23,"Once the pig snorted as if to lunge at the nostril but it did. The nostril began to take a step back."
24,"His eyes were still fixed like a pig's sty. Now the pig was right in front of him, charging towards him."
25,"In this position it was impossible to hold his hind leg and pull him backwards and turn him over on his back."
26,"The pig's tiny red eyes were full of lust. Who knew what he was doing. But Natthu was getting anxious."
27,"It was two o'clock and the work which could not be done since last evening till now, how will it be done by the time the po bursts? The Jamadar's line can come at any time and if the work is not done, trust Murad Ali's show? It has become a friend and an enemy.Sit down, stop flogging, put the knife out of the room, beat someone, harass."
28,"Nuthu's limbs began to flinch. He knew in his heart that if he caught the pig by its hind legs, it would bite or jump and free itself."
29,"Suddenly, the nose rose. For no apparent reason, it felt like a pain in the body."
30,"Saying,Not me, not this, he immediately turned back and picked up a big stone from the bottom of the cave. Picking up the stone, he went straight to the middle of the room."
31,"Lifting the stone with both hands above his head, he paused for a moment. The boar's scar was still on its foreleg. It was sniffing the bark of the teat."
32,"His red eyes were twinkling. His small tail was constantly behind his back."
33,"If it does not move and the stone hits its body directly, it will run somewhere and somewhere, and some part of the pig will be crushed."
34,"Even if one tog is broken, Ganimat, his walking will be more difficult than before. Then Natthu, folding both his hands, hurled the stone at the boar."
35,"The flame of the lamp placed in the gokhala flickered and shadows rose on the floor. The stone hit the pig."
36,"Tamas Lato, but Natthu didn't know exactly where it hit. The boar gave a loud shriek and the stone fell to the floor with a crash."
37,"Nattu fell back as soon as he had thrown the stone. And stared at the pig. Natthu was surprised to see that the pig's half-lidded eyes were blinking and its scar was still attached to its front leg."
38," suddenly the boar snorted and moved from the back to the middle of the room. It was swaying left and right. A core, leaning forward, moved towards the door opening into the courtyard and stopped. "
39,"In the flickering light of the lamp the boar was advancing like a black mass. The stone fell on its head."
40,"Ane Lauidhai, he may have got a fever and cannot see well. Natthu is afraid. The boar is coming forward."
41,"And that need would bite him. The stone did not seem to have any effect on him."
42,"Natthu quickly opened the door and went out of the room. In which figure the life was slaughtered, he muttered and stood near the stone slab on the porch in the courtyard."
43," Reaching outside he was relieved in the fresh air. He was disturbed by the stuffiness and stench of the room."
44,"His sweaty body felt boundless joy at the gentle touch of the air."
45,"For a while he felt as if he had not started living anew! Life had not come back to his limp dead body! What do I have to do with this work? If Salotari did not get the pig, then it was not for me."
46,"I will put the pouch note in front of Murad Ali tomorrow and join hands. This is not my job sir."
47,"I can't do this job. What is I going to waste? He will keep his mouth open for two days."
48,"I will put my hand on his knee and persuade him. He stood still by the katha."
49,"The moon had risen and in the sprinkled moonlight the whole region around it seemed strange and mysterious."
50,"The unpaved bullock road through Hasame fell asleep at this time. Silent and quiet, all day long the clatter of bullock-carts from the northern villages and the jingling of the bells tied to the oxen could be heard over it."
51,"The road was deeply rutted by his treads. And his soil was ground so fine that as soon as he set foot on it, his feet sank into the dust up to his knees."
52,"On the steep slope that led down to the plain across the road were small bushes and brambles and thorny boards strewn with dust. And washed in the moonlit night."
