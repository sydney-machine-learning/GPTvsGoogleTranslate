1,"What simple task did Tamas the piglet have to perform? He used to wander around and see the piglets wallowing in the garbage."
2,"Nothing else occurred to him. He kept lifting the garbage from the corner, bringing it to the doorstep, and placing the garbage bag there."
3,"During twilight, when the shadows began to lengthen, three pigs would arrive near the water trough, which was filled with dirty water, mud and dust."
4,"At that moment, one pig would sniff inside the trough, and immediately, it would grab the door of the garbage room and close it."
5,"Then, swiftly, he would open the door to the pigsty and push the piglet inside, using his own stick."
6,"The man from the pigsty would search for the pig in the garbage room, but it wouldn’t come to the side where the pigsty was. The piglet’s squeals went unheard, and it continued its risky work."
7,"When the pig entered the garbage room, it meant that the pig had lost its way, and the blind darkness outside the door was terrifying. The piglet kept pushing the door, trying to escape."
8,"Many times, late at night, when the wind was blowing harder, the piglet would sneak into the garbage room. In the middle of the dancing flames, he realized that the garbage was scattered all over."
9,"And from this, a peculiar smell like rotten eggs emanated. The heavily built, handsome piglet looked at it and felt a mixture of curiosity and disgust. He wondered what dangerous work he had undertaken."
10,"At that moment, he decided to quickly open the door of the garbage room and push the pig outside."
11,"By now, the night was darker than ever, and the piglet was engulfed in the thick smoke of the garbage."
12,"His body was covered in soot, and from this chaos, no path seemed visible. He stumbled upon a couple of stones near the garden’s fence."
13,"The piglet, like before, was alive and awake inside the garbage room. Whenever the piglet snorted, it was as if he was breathing in the same foul air."
14,"His body was sticky and slippery. He couldn’t find any way out of this mess. In the distant garden clock, the hands were pointing to two."
15,"Nathu, feeling anxious, stood still. His gaze fell on the pig again. The pig was urinating intermittently between the pieces of garbage."
16,"And due to this uneasiness, he started moving towards the pigsty, walking alongside the wall. Occasionally, he would glance back, as if he was afraid of some nightmare. He couldn’t find a way out."
17,"Like before, the piglet was alive and awake inside the garbage room. Whenever the piglet snorted, it was as if he was breathing in the same foul air."
18,"His body was sticky and slippery. He couldn’t find any way out of this mess. Near the garden clock, the hands were pointing to two."
19,"Nervously, the piglet stood still. His eyes…"
20,"Now, he decided to quickly grab the piglet’s leg and try to pull him out. He tried to lift the piglet’s hind legs, but the piglet resisted, pulling back with all its strength."
21,"He thought of pushing the piglet’s hind legs towards the door. He tried to untangle the piglet’s long, thin tail, which was like a twisted rope."
22,"The piglet refused to move, saying, ‘No, I won’t go. This disease is not mine. The pig will eat me today.’"
23,"So, he decided to quickly grab the piglet’s leg and push him outside. But the piglet resisted, making it impossible to lift him."
24,"His eyes were fixed on the piglet’s tail, which was hanging down. Now, the piglet was looking at him with the same fear in his eyes."
25,"In this situation, it seemed impossible to pull the piglet’s hind legs towards him. He tried to lift the piglet’s tail, but it slipped away."
26,"The pig’s small, red eyes were intoxicated. Who knows what it was thinking. But Nathu was restless."
27,"Both his legs were trembling, and the work he had left since evening couldn’t be completed until now. Could it be done in this state? Maybe Jamadar’s whip could motivate him, and if the work wasn’t done, he could rely on Murad Ali’s show. Even an enemy could become a friend, tie the leather straps, pull from the harness, make someone work, surprise them."
28,"Nathu’s hands and feet began to falter. He knew in his heart that if he tried to grab the pig’s hind legs, it would resist and slip away."
29,"Suddenly, Nathu stood up. Without any clear reason, he felt a strange sensation in every part of his body."
30,"Where am I? No, not this, he thought. Saying this, he quickly lifted a large stone lying behind the pigsty. Holding the stone, he reached the piglet directly."
31,"He lifted the stone above the pig’s head for a moment. Even now, the piglet’s hind legs were on the ground. He sniffed the piglet’s tail."
32,"His eyes were blinking rapidly. Behind him, the piglet’s small tail was still wagging."
33,"In this uncertain situation, if the stone directly hit the pig’s body, it would either hurt or break something. Then, whether it was the pig or some part of the pig, it would definitely get injured."
34,"If a stone breaks, it’s a gain. It will be difficult to move before it starts working. Then, Nathu grabbed both the pig’s legs and pushed the piglet outside."
35,"In the dim light of the lantern, the piglet’s eyes flickered, and it fell on the ground."
36,"Nathu felt darkness, but he still didn’t know where he was. The piglet was still sniffing and moving its hind legs."
37,"The stone that the donkey threw hit him right behind. And the pig turned its head to see. The donkey, upon seeing the pig, felt a sudden shock. The pig's left eye was blinking rapidly, and it had scratched its forehead with the next leg."
38,"Suddenly, the pig was startled and, from behind, it came running towards the door. It swung back and forth. The donkey, standing in the courtyard, saw the door open towards the pig."
39,"In the flickering light of the lamp, the pig appeared like a black shadow advancing. The stone had hit its head."
40,"And perhaps it had also hit its tail. But it didn't seem to show any visible signs. The donkey got scared. The pig was definitely moving its hind legs forward."
41,"And surely it must have been hurt. There seemed to be no effect on the stone's surface."
42,"The donkey quickly opened the door and rushed out. In what shape did it find the pig? It was huddled and standing near the prickly pear cactus in the courtyard."
43,"Outside, in the fresh air, it felt relieved. The pig was bothered by the dust and the stench."
44,"Next to it, the donkey's body experienced boundless joy from the gentle touch of the breeze."
45,"For a moment, it felt as if it hadn't come back to life since the New Year! In its lifeless body, breath hadn't returned. Did this deed go in vain? The solitary one hadn't found the pig, so it hadn't found my strength either."
46,"I will go to Murad Ali tomorrow, collect the note from the cashier, and fold my hands. This is not my job."
47,"This work cannot be done by me. What should I do? It will be kept for two days."
48,"I will place my hand on its forehead and pacify it. It was standing still near the prickly pear cactus."
49,"The moon had risen, and in the moonlight, it appeared mysterious and surrounded by the shimmering moon."
50,"The dusty, unpaved road that stretched out from the village was deserted at this time. Silent and calm, the donkeys' hooves clattered against the rough and dusty ground all day."
51,"From the trees along the road, it descended into the open field. The small, thorny bushes and the boards tied with ropes were echoing the sound of the donkeys' hooves."
52,"Crossing the field, it reached the straight path on the other side of the road. The narrow, thorny bushes and the boards with sharp edges were covered in dust, and the moonlit night witnessed it all."
